### About Me:
Currently I am working in company Elektrokomplekt LLC as product-manager in marketing department. In this position I have to communicate a lot with different people and sometimes from other countries. Thanks to this I developed a lot of usefull skills such us ability to efficiently work in team and resolve difficult situations in limited time.

I am grateful for all experience I've gained in this company and also for all good people I met here. But also I understand that I need to move on to grow as a person and in my career. 

This is why I decided to become a frontend-developer, as a long dream from a childhood. And there is no best time as now to pursuit this dream. So I am going to do my best to become efficient developer in future.
